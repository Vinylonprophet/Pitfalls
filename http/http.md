## Request

### Request-Interception

#### Form-Submission

The interception of form submissions can be done in **two ways**, with the most common approach being the use of event listeners. By listening for the 'submit' event and then utilizing the `preventDefault` method, the default form submission behavior is halted. This allows for the execution of custom logic or validation before the actual submission takes place.

##### 1. Listener

```javascript
document.getElementById('form').addEventListener('submit', function(event) {
  event.preventDefault();
});
```

In my work, I encountered a situation where the form is submitted directly in a script, for example, using `form.submit()`. By manipulating the form submission through scripts, it bypasses my interception, and I cannot prevent the request. In such cases, we can employ the second method.



##### 2. HTMLFormElement

We can intercept by modifying the prototype chain of `HTMLFormElement`. In this case, when we call the `submit()` method and trigger the submit event, the interception logic will take effect.

```javascript
var originalSubmit = HTMLFormElement.prototype.submit;

HTMLFormElement.prototype.submit = function() {
    var action = this.getAttribute('action');
    var method = this.getAttribute('method');

    console.log('Form submission intercepted!');
    
    if (method && method.toLowerCase() === 'post') {
        console.log('POST request to:', action);
    } else {
        console.log('Non-POST request. Method:', method, ' Action:', action);
    }

    originalSubmit.call(this);
};
```



**Considerations:**

1. Listeners are used to intercept button clicks.
2. Modifying the prototype chain of `HTMLFormElement` is employed for intercepting the `submit()` event called by scripts.



## API

### API Design

Designing a typical API request typically involves considerations in the following aspects:

1. HTTP Method: Defines the type of operation for the request. Common HTTP methods include GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc. GET is used to retrieve resources, POST to create resources, PUT to update resources, and DELETE to delete resources.
2. URL (Uniform Resource Locator): Contains the target address of the request. The URL should clearly specify the API endpoint and possible query parameters. For example, https://api.example.com/users.
3. Headers: Contain metadata about the request, such as authentication information, content type, and request timestamp. For example, Content-Type: application/json indicates that the request body contains JSON-formatted data.
4. Request Body: Applicable to certain HTTP methods (e.g., POST and PUT). It contains the data to be sent to the server. The data format is typically specified by the Content-Type field in the headers and can be JSON, XML, form data, etc.
5. Authentication: If the API requires authentication, the request needs to include appropriate authentication information, such as an API key or token. Authentication is usually passed through the headers, for example, Authorization: Bearer <token>.
6. Query Parameters: If the API supports query parameters, they can be added to the URL to filter, sort, or limit results. For example, https://api.example.com/users?role=admin&active=true.
7. Path Parameters: Sometimes, the URL of the API request includes path parameters used to specify a specific part of the resource. For example, https://api.example.com/users/{id}.
8. Error Handling: When designing requests, consider potential errors and establish suitable error-handling mechanisms. Error messages are typically returned in the form of standard HTTP status codes and error messages.

#### API Headers

The response headers of an API can contain various information, and the specific content depends on the requirements and implementation of your API. Here are some common response header fields:

**Content-Type:** Specifies the media type of the response body. Common values include application/json, text/html, application/xml, etc.

```http
Content-Type: application/json
```

**Content-Length:** Indicates the length of the response body in bytes.

```http
Content-Length: 1024
```

**Cache-Control:** Controls caching behavior, including the maximum cache duration and whether it can be cached.

```http
Cache-Control: max-age=3600, public
```

**Date:** Indicates the date and time when the response was sent.

```http
Date: Tue, 21 Feb 2024 12:34:56 GMT
```

**Server:** Describes information about the server.

```http
Server: My Awesome Server
```

**ETag:** Used to verify if the resource in the cache is the same as on the server.

```http
ETag: "abc123"
```

**Location:** In a redirection response, indicates the URL to which the client should redirect.

```http
Location: https://example.com/new-location
```

**Access-Control-Allow-Origin:** Allows sources for cross-origin requests.

```http
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
```

**Content-Disposition:** Specifies how to display the response result, especially for file downloads.

```http
Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="example.txt"
```

**Set-Cookie:** Sets a cookie in the response.

```http
Set-Cookie: user_id=123; Max-Age=3600; Path=/
```

These are just some common response header fields, and their specific usage depends on the design and requirements of your API. When designing an API, ensure that the response headers include appropriate information for clients to parse and handle the response correctly.



##### 1. Content-Type

In addition to application/json, the Content-Type in the HTTP header can be set to other common media types depending on the requirements of your application and API. Here are some common Content-Type types:

**Text Types:**

- **text/plain:** Plain text without any formatting.
- **text/html:** HTML documents.

**XML Types:**

- **application/xml:** Data in XML format.

**Form Types:**

- **application/x-www-form-urlencoded:** Form data, typically used for HTML form submissions.
- **multipart/form-data:** Multi-part form data, commonly used for file uploads.

**JSON Type:**

- **application/json:** Data in JSON format.

**Binary Type:**

- **application/octet-stream:** Binary data, typically used for file downloads.

**JavaScript Type:**

- **application/javascript:** JavaScript scripts.

**CSS Type:**

- **text/css:** CSS style sheets.

**Image Types:**

- **image/jpeg, image/png, image/gif:** Different formats of images.

When setting the Content-Type, ensure to choose the appropriate type to ensure the client can correctly parse the response. Typically, use application/json for returning JSON data, text/plain or text/html for text data, and multipart/form-data for file uploads, among others.



##### 2. Content-Length

`Content-Length` is an HTTP header field used to indicate the length, in bytes, of the HTTP message body being sent to the server or returned from the server. This field is typically employed to determine the end position of the message body, ensuring proper parsing of the HTTP message.

In HTTP requests, when a message body is included (for example, in a POST request), the client uses `Content-Length` to inform the server about the size of the message body. The server can then utilize this information to properly read and parse the request's message body.

In HTTP responses, the server uses the `Content-Length` header to indicate the size of the response message body being sent to the client. The client can use this information to ensure the complete reception of the response message body.



##### 3. Cache-Control

`Cache-Control` is an HTTP header field used to control caching behavior. This field provides instructions on how caching should store, retrieve, and revalidate resources. In HTTP requests and responses, `Cache-Control` offers flexible control over caching behavior, aiding in performance optimization and reducing network traffic.

Here are some common `Cache-Control` directives:

1. **public/private**: Specifies whether the response can be stored by any cache (public) or is limited to a single user's private cache (private).

2. **max-age**: Specifies the maximum time, in seconds, from the request time that the resource should be considered fresh. Beyond this time, the cache is deemed expired and requires revalidation.

3. **no-cache**: Indicates that the cache should not use the response directly, and a request needs to be sent to the origin server to obtain the complete response. However, it still allows intermediate caches (proxies) to validate whether the resource is still valid.

4. **no-store**: Indicates that neither the request nor the response should be stored, disallowing any caching.

5. **must-revalidate**: Instructs caches to revalidate expired resources before using them. If a resource is expired and cannot be validated, the cache must fetch the resource again.

These are just some common directives of the `Cache-Control` header; there are additional directives and parameters that can be combined as needed. The flexibility of this header allows developers to precisely control caching behavior when balancing performance and real-time requirements.



##### 4. Date



##### 5. Server

The `Server` response header is used to specify information about the web server software currently in use. It allows the client to understand the type and version of the server sending the response.

For example, a `Server` header might contain information like this:

```
Server: Apache/2.4.41 (Unix) OpenSSL/1.1.1c
```

This tells the client that the server is using Apache software, version 2.4.41, running on a Unix operating system, and using OpenSSL encryption library version 1.1.1c.

As a developer, using the `Server` header can serve the following purposes:

1. **Server Identification:** Provide client-side information identifying the current server. This is useful for debugging and monitoring network traffic.

2. **Security and Compliance:** Ensure the use of the latest and secure server software versions. Some security and compliance standards may require exposing the server software's version information to ensure timely security updates.

3. **Debugging and Maintenance:** During development and maintenance, understanding the server's version and configuration can assist in resolving issues specific to the server software.

Note that sometimes, to enhance security or for other security policy reasons, some websites and applications may choose to hide or modify the `Server` header to prevent the leakage of too much information.



##### 6. **ETag**

`ETag` (Entity Tag) is a part of the HTTP response header, used to identify the version of a resource. It is typically generated by the server and aids in cache management between the client and server to determine if the resource has been modified.

**Purpose:**

1. **Cache Validation:** When a client requests a specific resource, it can include the `ETag` value received during the last resource retrieval. The server can use this value to determine if the client's cached resource is still the latest. If the resource has changed, the server returns the new resource; if unchanged, the server can respond with a `304 Not Modified` status, instructing the client to continue using the cached version.

2. **Reduce Bandwidth Consumption:** Using `ETag` helps minimize unnecessary bandwidth consumption. If the resource hasn't changed, the server only needs to return a `304 Not Modified` response instead of transmitting the entire resource content.

`ETag` is a crucial mechanism in HTTP caching and validation, contributing to optimizing network performance and reducing unnecessary resource transfers.
